# Flounder Score

## Introduction

This library implements the "Flounder Score", and tools to help use it.

## TODO

Things that might be fun to do, for small but interesting values of fun:

- [ ] Accept FASTA data as a string.
- [ ] Accept FASTA data as a file.
- [X] Add a cumulative score approach -- every letter a base can hit adds to
      that base's score (in other words, given a base, use its score and
      also the score of every IUPAC code that relates to it).
